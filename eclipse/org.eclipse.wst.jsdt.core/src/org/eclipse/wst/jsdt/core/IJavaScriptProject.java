/**
 * A JavaScript project represents a view of a project resource in terms of JavaScript
 * elements such as package fragments, types, methods and fields.
 * A project may contain several source folders (package roots), which contain source folders (package fragments).
 * A package root corresponds to an underlying folder.
 * <p>
 * Each JavaScript project has a includepath, defining which folders contain source code and
 * where required libraries are located. A project that
 * references packages in another project can access the packages by including
 * the required project in a includepath entry. The JavaScript model will present the
 * source elements in the required project. The includepath format is a sequence of includepath entries
 * describing the location and contents of package fragment roots.
 * </p>
 * JavaScript project elements need to be opened before they can be navigated or manipulated.
 * The children of a JavaScript project are the package fragment roots that are
 * defined by the includepath and contained in this project (in other words, it
 * does not include package fragment roots for other projects).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients. An instance
 * of one of these handles can be created via
 * <code>JavaScriptCore.create(project)</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see JavaScriptCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject)
 * @see IIncludePathEntry
 *  
 * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken 
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
