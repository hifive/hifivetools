/**
 * Optional extensions that may be implemented by an
 * {@link org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.IVMInstall}.
 * <p>
 * When an <code>IVMInstall</code> implements this interface,
 * clients must call <code>getVMArgs()</code> in place of 
 * <code>getVMArguments()</code> and <code>setVMArgs(String)</code> in place of
 * <code>setVMArguments(String[])</code>. This avoids the problem noted
 * in bug 73493.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additionally, this interface optionally provides the JavaScript version
 * associated with a VM install. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients that implement {@link org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.IVMInstall} may additionally
 * implement this interface. However, it is strongly recommended that clients subclass
 * {@link org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.AbstractVMInstall} instead, which already implements
 * this interface, and will insulate clients from additional API additions in the future.
 * </p>
 * 
 * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken 
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
