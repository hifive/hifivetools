/**
 * Represents a particular installation of a VM. A VM instance holds all parameters
 * specific to a VM installation. Unlike VM types, VM instances can be created and
 * configured dynamically at run-time. This is typically done by the user 
 * interactively in the UI.
 * <p>
 * A VM install is responsible for creating VM runners to launch a JavaScript program
 * in a specific mode.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by clients that contribute
 * to the <code>"org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.vmInstallTypes"</code> extension point.
 * Rather than implementing this interface directly, it is strongly recommended that
 * clients subclass {@link org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.AbstractVMInstall} to be insulated
 * from potential API additions. In 3.1, a new optional interface has been added for
 * implementors of this interface - {@link org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.IVMInstall2}.
 * The new interface is implemented by {@link org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.AbstractVMInstall}.
 * </p>
 * @see org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.IVMInstall2
 * 
 * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken 
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
