/**
 * A includepath provider computes an unresolved includepath for a launch
 * configuration, and resolves includepath entries for a launch configuration.
 * A includepath provider is defined as an extension of type 
 * <code>org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.includepathProvider</code>.
 * <p>
 * A provider is registered with an identifier that can be
 * referenced by a launch configuration. A includepath provider is consulted
 * to compute a includepath or source lookup path when a launch configuration
 * references a provider in one or both of the following attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>ATTR_CLASSPATH_PROVIDER</code></li>
 * <li><code>ATTR_SOURCE_PATH_PROVIDER</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * A provider extension is defined in <code>plugin.xml</code>.
 * Following is an example definition of a runtime includepath provider
 * extension.
 * <pre>
 * &lt;extension point="org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.launching.includepathProviders"&gt;
 *   &lt;includepathProvider 
 *      id="com.example.ExampleClasspathProvider"
 *      class="com.example.ExampleClasspathProviderImpl"
 *   &lt;/includepathProvider&gt;
 * &lt;/extension&gt;
 * </pre>
 * The attributes are specified as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>id</code> specifies a unique identifier for this extension. This 
 * 	identifier may be used to reference a provider on one of the launch
 *  configuration attributes mentioned above.</li>
 * <li><code>class</code> specifies the fully qualified name of the JavaScript class
 *   that implements <code>IRuntimeClasspathProvider</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken 
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
