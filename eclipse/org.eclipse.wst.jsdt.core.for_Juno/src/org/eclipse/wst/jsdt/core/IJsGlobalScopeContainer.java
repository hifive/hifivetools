/**
 * Interface of a includepath container.
 * A includepath container provides a way to indirectly reference a set of includepath entries through
 * a includepath entry of kind <code>CPE_CONTAINER</code>. Typically, a includepath container can
 * be used to describe a complex library composed of filess or projects, considering also
 * that containers can map to different set of entries on each project, in other words, several
 * projects can reference the same generic container path, but have each of them actually bound
 * to a different container object.
 * <p>
 * The set of entries associated with a includepath container may contain any of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li> library entries (<code>CPE_LIBRARY</code>) </li>
 * <li> project entries (<code>CPE_PROJECT</code>) </li>
 * </ul>
 * In particular, a includepath container can neither reference further includepath containers or includepath variables.
 * <p>
 * Classpath container values are persisted locally to the workspace, but are not preserved from a
 * session to another. It is thus highly recommended to register a <code>JsGlobalScopeContainerInitializer</code>
 * for each referenced container (through the extension point "org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.JsGlobalScopeContainerInitializer").
 * <p>
 * @see IIncludePathEntry
 *  
 * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken 
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.

	 * The set of entries associated with a includepath container may contain any of the following:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> library entries (<code>CPE_LIBRARY</code>) </li>
	 * <li> project entries (<code>CPE_PROJECT</code>) </li>

	 * This method is called by the JavaScript model when it needs to resolve this
	 * includepath container entry into a list of library and project entries.
	 * The method is typically called exactly once for a given JavaScript project,
	 * and the resulting list of entries cached internally by the JavaScript model.
	 * This method must not be called by other clients.
	 * <p>
	 * There are a wide variety of conditions under which this method may be
	 * invoked. To ensure that the implementation does not interfere with
	 * correct functioning of the JavaScript model, the implementation should use
	 * only the following JavaScript model APIs:

	 * <li>{@link JavaScriptCore#newProjectEntry(IPath, boolean)} and variants</li>

	 * <li>{@link JavaScriptCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject)}</li>

	 * <li>{@link IJavaScriptProject#readOutputLocation()}</li>

	 * The effects of using other JavaScript model APIs are unspecified.
